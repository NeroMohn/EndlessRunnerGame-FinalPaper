# Endless Runner Game - Unity Project

This repository contains the source code for an Endless Runner game developed in Unity. The project was created as part of the final paper for the completion of my undergraduate degree in Information Systems.

## Project Overview
- **Objective:** This Endless Runner game is designed as an engaging and interactive way to showcase the integration of Unity, Arduino, and an accelerometer as a unique controller.

- **Controller Setup:** The game utilizes an Arduino Nano board connected to an MPU5060 accelerometer, providing a novel and immersive gaming experience.

- **Academic Context:** Developed as part of the requirements for a Bachelor's degree in Information Systems

## Note
While the project is in a somewhat raw state, it functions effectively. Feel free to explore, modify, and enhance the code as needed.

## Hardware Specifications
- **Arduino Board:** Arduino Nano
- **Accelerometer:** MPU5060

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Unity project in your Unity development environment.
3. Ensure that the necessary Arduino setup is in place for the MPU5060 accelerometer to function as the controller. It uses the serial port to read the movement data
4. Run the Unity game and start playing with the Arduino Nano and MPU5060 accelerometer controller.
